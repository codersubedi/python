# Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the begining of a code line

# a = 5
# b = 2

# if a > b:
#     print('a is greater than b') (It was correct because it has indentation or 4 spaces)

# if a > b:
# print('a is greater than b')      (It shows error becausw there has no space)
