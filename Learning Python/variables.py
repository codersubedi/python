# Variables 
# In python, variables are created when you assign a value to it.

# x = 5 integer variable
# y = 'Hello World' string variable

# here x is a variable and 5 is the value which we assigned to it
# same goes to y as well. y is a variable and hello world is a value 

# Cpmments

# This is a comment
# print('Hello world')

# Python has no command for declaring a variable
# A variable is created the moment, you first assign a value to it

# x = 5
# y = john

# print(x)
# print(y)

# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after thet have been set

# x = 4 x is now type of integer
# x = 'Sally' x is not type of string
# print(x)

# Casting

# If you want to specify the data type of variable, this can be done with casting 

# x = str(3) # x will be '3'
# y = int(3) # y will be 3
# z = float(3) # z will be '3.0'

# Get the type

# You can get the data type of variable with the type() function.

# x = 5
# y = 'John'

# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))

# Multi words variable names

# Camel case = Each word, except the first, starts with capital letter:

# myVariableName = 'John'
 
# Pascal case = Each word starts with capital letter

# MyVariableName = 'John'

# Snake case = Each word is seperated by an underscore character:

# my_variable_name = 'John'

# Assign multiple variables

# x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

# Assign single values to multiple variables

# x, y, z = "Orange"

# Unpack a collection

# fruits = ['Orange', 'Banana', 'Cherry']
# X, Y, Z = fruits
